# Student-Progress-Tracking-System
This Python program determines the progression outcome of students based on their pass, defer, and fail credits. It checks whether a student progresses, is excluded, or needs to retrieve modules. The program stores results in a text file and displays a histogram graph of the outcomes using the `graphics` module.
